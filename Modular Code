Modular Code & Cleaner Structure

Refactored code into separate functions (update_graph(), update_dropdowns(), etc.), making it more modular and readable.

Difference:

Old Code: Functions had mixed responsibilities (e.g., update_graph() also managed UI updates).

New Code: Modular structure improves maintainability.
