Dropdown Menus for Edge Selection
Replaced manual Entry() text fields (from_entry, to_entry) with ttk.Combobox for selecting nodes instead of typing them manually.
Improved user experience by preventing invalid node selection.
Difference:
Old Code: Used text entries, requiring manual input.
New Code: Uses dropdown menus (ttk.Combobox) for error-free selection.
